## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Overview

The heart of this project lies in its n8n workflow, which orchestrates the entire data pipeline from fetching raw data to enriching it with AI and storing the results.

*   **n8n Workflow Description:**
    *   The journey begins with a `Start` node, acting as the trigger for the automated process.
    *   A `Google Sheets` node, configured for a `Read` operation, fetches the initial dataset from a specified Google Sheet, serving as the raw data input.
    *   Following this, a `Function` node processes the incoming data. This node typically contains custom JavaScript logic to prepare the data for AI interaction, structure it appropriately, or perform preliminary transformations.
    *   The prepared data then flows into a `Google Gemini` node. Here, the data is sent along with a defined prompt to the Google Gemini AI model. The AI processes the input and returns AI-generated responses, which might include summaries, sentiment analysis, entity extraction, or content generation.
    *   Finally, another `Google Sheets` node, configured for an `Append` operation, takes the AI-processed and transformed data and writes it back into a designated Google Sheet, ensuring the results are saved and accessible.

*   **Screenshot Descriptions:**
    *   `n8n-workflow-screenshot-1.png`: This image displays the initial segment of the n8n workflow. It shows the `Start` node connected to the first `Google Sheets` node (configured for reading), which then links to the `Function` node. This visually represents the data fetching and preliminary processing steps.
    *   `n8n-workflow-screenshot-2.png`: This screenshot illustrates the latter part of the n8n workflow. It depicts the connection from the `Function` node to the `Google Gemini` node, and subsequently to the final `Google Sheets` node (configured for appending data). This highlights the AI integration and the ultimate output of the processed data.

*   **Node.js Script (`index.js`):**
    The `index.js` script, as defined in `package.json`, serves as a standalone data processing component or can be integrated into the n8n workflow (e.g., within a `Function` node or executed via an `Execute Command` node). It utilizes libraries like `csv-parser` for handling CSV data, `node-fetch` for making HTTP requests to external APIs, and `@google/generative-ai` for direct, programmatic interaction with Google's AI models. This script is responsible for core data transformations, AI prompting, and result handling outside of the n8n visual flow.

*   **Video Demonstrations:**
    *   `video.mp4`: This video likely demonstrates the setup and execution of the n8n workflow. It may show how to configure credentials for Google Sheets and Google Gemini nodes, walk through the data flow within the workflow, and provide a quick overview of input and output data in Google Sheets.
    *   `video-1.mp4`: This video probably offers a more in-depth walkthrough of the entire project, potentially covering the execution of the `index.js` script, guiding on setting up environment variables, and showcasing a comprehensive end-to-end demonstration of the data processing, AI enrichment, and final data storage.

## üß™ Example Output

The `output.json` file contains a sample of the transformed and AI-enriched data. This demonstrates how raw input is processed and enhanced by the Gemini AI model, providing structured and insightful results.

```json

    "record_id": "tx001",
    "original_description": "The new software update significantly improved performance and fixed several bugs. Users are very happy.",
    "ai_summary": "Software update enhances performance and fixes bugs, leading to high user satisfaction.",
    "sentiment": "positive",
    "keywords": ["software update", "performance", "bug fix", "user satisfaction"]
  },
  {
    "record_id": "tx002",
