    "output": "# üöÄ Project Introduction\n\nWelcome to the **Quote Generator** project! üéâ This simple yet elegant web application provides users with a dose of inspiration by displaying random quotes. It's designed to be a quick and easy way to discover new quotes and share them with friends.\n\nThe project emphasizes a clean user interface and smooth functionality, making the experience of getting a new quote delightful. Whether you need motivation, a moment of reflection, or just a thought-provoking statement, this app delivers it instantly.\n\n## ‚ú® Features\n\n*   üìù **Random Quote Display**: Get a new, random quote with the click of a button.\n*   üñãÔ∏è **Author Attribution**: Each quote is displayed with its respective author.\n*   üê¶ **Tweet Quote Functionality**: Easily share your favorite quotes directly to Twitter.\n*   üì± **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.\n*   üîÑ **Dynamic Content**: Quotes are loaded from an external JavaScript file, making it easy to expand the collection.\n*   üöÄ **Fast and Lightweight**: Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for optimal performance.\n\n## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Overview\n\nThe Quote Generator operates with a straightforward and intuitive workflow:\n\n*   **Page Load**: When the `index.html` page is opened in a browser, it immediately initializes the application.\n*   **Quote Initialization**: The `script.js` file loads a collection of quotes from `quotes.js`.\n*   **Initial Quote Display**: A random quote from the loaded collection is selected and displayed on the screen, showing both the quote text and its author.\n*   **User Interaction - New Quote**:\n    *   A \"New Quote\" button is available on the interface.\n    *   When the user clicks this button, `script.js` selects another random quote.\n    *   The displayed quote and author are instantly updated.\n    *   A loading spinner briefly appears and disappears to indicate the content change.\n*   **User Interaction - Tweet Quote**:\n    *   A \"Tweet\" button allows users to share the currently displayed quote.\n    *   Clicking this button constructs a Twitter sharing URL with the quote and author, opening it in a new tab for easy posting.\n*   **Visual Elements**:\n    *   The application uses a clean design defined by `style.css`.\n    *   Images like `image-1.jpg` and `image-2.jpg` are available in the project, which could be integrated for background visuals or dynamic themes (though not actively cycled by the provided `script.js`).\n\n## üß™ Example Output\n\nUpon opening the application, you would see a clean, centrally aligned card containing a quote and its author. For instance:\n\n```\n\"The only way to do great work is to love what you do.\"\n- Steve Jobs\n```\n\nBelow the quote, you'd find two buttons: one labeled \"New Quote\" to refresh the content, and another \"Tweet\" button with a Twitter icon to share the current quote. If a quote is particularly long, its font size will automatically adjust to fit within the container. The background of the page would be a visually appealing, subtle gradient or solid color as defined in the styling.\n\n## üöÄ Getting Started\n\nFollow these simple steps to get the Quote Generator up and running on your local machine.\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1.  **Clone the Repository**:\n    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the project repository:\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/akshithareddy/quote-generator.git # Replace with actual repo URL if different\n    ```\n2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:\n    ```bash\n    cd quote-generator\n    ```\n3.  **No further installation is required**, as this is a front-end only project.\n\n### How to Run the Project\n\n1.  **Open `index.html`**:\n    Simply locate the `index.html` file in the project directory and open it with your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).\n\n    Alternatively, from your project directory, you can type:\n    ```bash\n    open index.html # For macOS\n    start index.html # For Windows\n    xdg-open index.html # For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)\n    ```\n2.  The application will load in your browser, displaying a random quote immediately.\n3.  Click the \"New Quote\" button to get another quote, or the \"Tweet\" button to share the current one.\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack\n\nThis project is built using the fundamental web technologies:\n\n*   **HTML5**: For the basic structure and content of the web page.\n*   **CSS3**: For styling the application, ensuring a clean, responsive, and visually appealing user interface.\n*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For dynamic behavior, fetching quotes, handling user interactions, and updating the DOM.\n\n## üë§ Author is akshitha reddy"
